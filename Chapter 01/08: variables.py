# Variables and Assignment Statements
# print("Hello world!")
# Assigning a value to a variable
message = "Hello, world!"

# Displaying the value of a variable
print(message)


# Assigning a new value to the same variable
message = "Hello, Python!"

# Displaying the new value of the variable
print(message)

# Assigning a value to a variable
number = 42

# Displaying the value of a variable
print(number)


# Assigning a new value to the same variable
number = 7

# Displaying the new value of the variable
print(number)


# Rules for variable names
# A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore
_number ="Hello"
print(_number)
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# 1number = "Hello"
# print(1number)

# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
var_name="variable name"
print(var_name)
# Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different variables)
name = "Alice"
Name = "Bob"
print(name,Name)
# Variable names cannot be a reserved word in Python (e.g., print, def, if, else, etc.)
# def = "Hello"
# print(def)
