# Variables and Assignment Statements

# Assigning a value to a variable
# message = "Hello, world!"

# Displaying the value of a variable
# print(message)


# Assigning a new value to the same variable
# message = "Hello, Python!"

# Displaying the new value of the variable

# Rules for variable names
# A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
# Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different variables)
# Variable names cannot be a reserved word in Python (e.g., print, def, if, else, etc.)
